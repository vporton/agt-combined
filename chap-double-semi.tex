\chapter{Actionable semigroups}

Each definition contining the word ``semicategory'' will also implicity create a similar definition for semigroups.

\chapter{Restricted identity transformations}

Fix an ordered semicategory action.

\emph{Semicategory action with identities} is an ordered semicategory~$S$ action~$\supfun{}$ together with a function $p\mapsto\id_p\in S$ such that whenever these equalities are defined
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\supfun{\id_p}x=x\sqcap p$;
\item ${\id_p}\circ f\sqsubseteq f$;
\item $f\circ\id_p\sqsubseteq f$.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{obvious}
For every ordered semicategory action with identities, the identity transformations are entirely defined on their domains.
\end{obvious}

\begin{prop}
$x\mapsto\id_x$ is an injection.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
Let $x\ne y$. Then $x\ne x\sqcap y$ (possibly, $x\sqcap y$ is undefined).
\[ \supfun{\id_y}x=x\sqcap y\ne x=x\sqcap x=\supfun{\id_x}x. \]
\end{proof}

\begin{defn}
Another axiom (that we don't need now) is ${\id_p}\circ{\id_q}=\id_{p\sqcap q}$.
\end{defn}

\emph{Restriction} of an interspace~$a$ to element~$x$ is $a|_x=a\circ{\id_x}$.

\emph{Square restriction} (a generalization of restriction of a topological space, metric space, etc.) of a space~$a$ to element~$x$ is ${\id_x}\circ a\circ{\id_x}$.

\section{Actionable semigroups}

\begin{defn}
An \emph{actionable semicategory} is an semicategory, and $\cdot$ is a binary operation on $A$ such that $(g\circ f)\cdot x = g\cdot(f\cdot x)$.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
An \emph{ordered actionable semicategory} is an actionable semicategory which is also an ordered semicategory with additional equation:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $f_0\sqsubseteq f_0\land g_1\sqsubseteq g_0 \Rightarrow g_0\cdot f_0\sqsubseteq g_1\cdot f_1$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
An \emph{actionable semicategory with identities} is an actionable semicategory that is also a semicategory with identities.
\end{defn}

\begin{rem}
An actionable semigroup is an universal algebra.
\end{rem}

\begin{rem}
Actionable ordered semigroups and actionable semigroups with identities are relational algebras.
\end{rem}

\begin{rem}
It is even an universal algebra signature\footnote{See here for \href{https://chatgpt.com/s/t_691e8f88da64819184591f9e310e1728}{properties of categories isomorphic to universal algebras}.} in the case of up or down semilattice.
\end{rem}

TODO: Prove that it has the same signature for up or down semilattice.

\section{From actionable semicategory to semicategory action}

\begin{defn}
If $(\dots,\circ,\cdot)$ is an actionable semicategory, then we can define the operation $\supfun{}$ by $\supfun{f}x = f\cdot x$.
\end{defn}

\begin{obvious}
The above defines an semicategory action with identities with operations~$\circ$ and~$\supfun{}$.
\end{obvious}

\begin{rem}
Semicategory actions defined this way have the sets of objects and morphisms equal to each other.
\end{rem}

\section{From semicategory action with identities to actionable semicategory}

Let $(A,\circ,\supfun{})$ be an ordered semicategory action with identities, each object set having greatest element~$\top$.

\begin{obvious}
$\supfun{f}x = \supfun{f}\supfun{\id_x}\top = \supfun{f\circ\id_x}\top = \im(f\circ\id_x)$
\end{obvious}

By analogy with the above obvious, we can define $g\cdot f = \supfun{g}f = \id_{\im(g\circ f)}$.

\begin{prop}
The above defines an actionable semicategory with identities.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
Really, $(g\circ f)\cdot x = \id_{\im(g\circ f\circ x)} = \id_{\supfun{g}\supfun{f}\supfun{x}\top} = \id_{\supfun{g}{\im(f\circ x)}} = \id_{\supfun{g}(\top\sqcap\im(f\circ x))} = \id_{\im(g\circ(y\mapsto y\sqcap\im(f\circ x))} = \id_{\im(g\circ\id_{\im(f\circ x)})} = g\cdot(f\cdot x)$.

Monotonicity is obvious.
\end{proof}

\section{An injection}

Then \[ g\cdot\id_x = \supfun{g}\id_x = \id_{\im(g\circ\id_x)} = \id_{\supfun{g}x}. \]

So, we extended the mapping $\supfun{g}$ to a wider set, because $x\mapsto\id_x$ is an injection.

We can also restrict it to restricted identities: $\supfun{f}\id_x = f\cdot\id_x$ and obtain this way an ordered semicategory action isomorphic to the original one.

\section{Compositions of our ``inducing'' operations}

Every semicategory action with identities, whose objects have greatest elements, induces an actionable semicategory with identities, which induces another semicategory action with identities. Thus every semigroup with identities, whose objects have greatest elements, induces another semigroup with identities.

\fxnote{What happens if we apply this ``inducing'' two times to a semicategory having both greatest elements of objects and greatest morphisms in $\Mor$-sets?}

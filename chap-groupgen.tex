\chapter{generalization of Groups}

Let $\pi$ be a set of permutation groups~$G$ (on set~$M_G$), such as the symmetry groups of Euclidean spaces
(??relation to $\mathbb{R}^n$), $M_G$ in this case is the set of subsets of the space.

TODO: It is applicable to semigroups, too. What's about semicategories?

It induces ordered semicategory action with elements (spaces) $\mu$ determined by $G$ such that
$\supfun{\mu}S=\setcond{\rsupfun{f}S}{f\in G,S\in\subsets M_G}$, where arguments~$S$ are ordered by set-inclusion
and spaces~$\mu$ are ordered by
\[ \mu_0\sqsubseteq\mu_1\Leftrightarrow\forall G\in\pi, S\in M_G:\supfun{\mu_0}S\sqsubseteq\supfun{\mu_1}S. \]
(TODO: Prove it is an OSA.)
(For Euclidean spaces that is the set of all moves of sets of sets.)
